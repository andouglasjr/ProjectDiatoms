# ProjectDiatoms

In this project we applied Deep Learning to identify and classify microparticles in water samples. To do so, we acquire holograms using a holographic system and applied several techniques in order to get the intensity and phase informations to be used in the classification task. The results of this research was published in the Journal Sensors and can be accessed here: https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/21/6353. It was used several CNNs architectures, sush as ResNet, DenseNet, SENet, EfficientNet and RegNet.
